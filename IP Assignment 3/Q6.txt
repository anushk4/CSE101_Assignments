A part:

Advantages of using OO:
1. It makes the program modular so it becomes easier to debug the code or reuse the same code in different parts of the program.
2. Problems can be solved by breaking it into smaller problems which increases the efficiency.

Advantages of using dictionary:
1. The time complexity of dictionary is less than OO.
2. The code requires less number of lines.

Disadvantages of using OO:
1. The size of the program and the number of lines is more.
2. The time complexity is more for OO.

Disadvantages of using dictionary:
1. The code for dictionary cannot be reused unless functions are used for the same operation.
2. It is more difficult to debug the code in comparison to OO.
